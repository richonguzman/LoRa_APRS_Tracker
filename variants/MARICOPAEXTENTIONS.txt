Brief outline of the Maricopa Extentions that are included in this branch.

These extentions are additional network rules aimed at interoperability with 
the existing LoRa network. Their goals are to extend the distance a node packet can be recieved. Additionally we partially mitigate 
the infamous hiden transmitter problem.

Assumtions are:

- Transmitting over another stations is acceptable, if a station cannot be heard
- The modulation speeds in LoRa are such that channel capacity is on a novel scale in amateur radio, and consists of a new paradigm
- Each node has a list of several LoRa "profiles", where each profile defines a moduleation type and frequency.
- Each modulation type is orthaganal to other types, thus multiple modulation types on a single channel does not automatically increate channel load

These extentions work in tandum, each adding a level of complexity. Extentions can be implimented at any level.

*Extention 1:*
Mutlti-packet 
Each node simply transmits a single packet for each one of these profiles every tranmission.

*Extention 2:* 
Rotate RX
Each node roatates which profile it uses for recieving every 15 seconds. This allows for multi-region interoperability, where profiles 
can be used for the desired mode of operation

*Extention 3:*
Offset regional RX 
Each node that is synchronized to GPS delays the rotation time based on the node's Madenhead locator. This creates zones of 
profiles, where for each node, farther away nodes are aligned to recieve higher sensitivity profiles.
